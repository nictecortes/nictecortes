### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nicte Cortes 
Iâ€™m currently taking CS50: Introduction to computer science course\
Ask me about my cat's video game (It was my first project so I'm super excited about it)
More about me: I love to draw and paint and you can find me on instagram as @hijadelosdioses.
Fun fact: I sing in the shower and dance in the kitchen.
Secret identity: I'm artist in the morning, historian in the afternoon and I'm learning coding at night.
I speak Spanish and English, more Spanish than English though but I'm working on that.
